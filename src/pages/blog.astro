  <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>

    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
  </p>
  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
